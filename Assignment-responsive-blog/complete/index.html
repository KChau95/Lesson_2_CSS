            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Kevin Chau is a multifaceted creator whose career bridges real-estate, technology, and entrepreneurship. By day he oversees thousands of rental units as a construction-savvy property manager, drawing on hands-on experience to spot under- or overpriced homes and even developing an algorithm that automates those valuations. After hours, you’ll find him deep in code—whether refining full-stack web apps in JavaScript, Python, or C#, experimenting with AWS cloud deployments, or building data-scraping tools with BeautifulSoup and Playwright. Kevin also runs Ritz Nails, a salon whose modern website he designed himself, and he’s constantly sketching new side projects—from a spider-identification app to a Discord bot for the iPhone game Last War. Equal parts analyst and storyteller, he’s now exploring film critique, eager to merge his eye for detail with a love of cinema. Above all, Kevin thrives on learning, turning each new skill into practical solutions that make businesses—and experiences—bette</p>

            <p>Over the past two weeks you’ve stitched together a solid foundation in front‑end fundamentals: you mapped out the purpose of key semantic HTML tags—header, main, section, article, aside, and footer—so screen‑readers and search engines can navigate your pages with ease; you drilled into modern CSS layout strategies, dissecting display: flex to tame alignment, spacing, and re‑flow without resorting to floats; and you compiled a personal CSS “cheat sheet” that records go‑to selectors, shorthand properties, and responsive‑design breakpoints. Along the way you asked how to make pages look “professional,” prompting a focus on consistent typography scales, intuitive visual hierarchy, and mobile‑first media queries. Altogether, those exercises have turned isolated syntax facts into an organized, reusable toolkit you can now bring to any project.</p>
